## Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search

Approximate Nearest Neighbor techniques speed up the search by preprocessing the data into an efficient index and are often tackled using these phases:

- **Vector Transformation** — applied on vectors before they are indexed, amongst them, there is dimensionality reduction and vector rotation.

- **Vector Encoding** — applied on vectors in order to construct the actual index for search, amongst these, there are data structure-based techniques like Trees, LSH, and Quantization a technique to encode the vector to a much more compact form.

- **None Exhaustive Search Component** — applied on vectors in order to avoid exhaustive search, amongst these techniques there are Inverted Files and Neighborhood Graphs.
